Ellie -- your last year has been full of adventure, growth, tough stuff, and the hard work of world-changing. I couldn't be more impressed with the strength, resilience, kindness, and sense of humor you've displyed despite the hand you've been dealt in Moz, so I wanted to make a website that helped you see how transformative the past year plus has been. You move mountains every day. I couldn't be prouder or more honored to be your sister.

I got this illustration commissioned by a local artist in SF. I think it embodies the epic and important work you are doing. For mom and dad's anniversary, I'm getting the image printed and it will hang on the wall in the NYC apartment. When you're back in the States and settled in, I'll get it printed and framed for you, too.

Love you muchly muchly. The moves you've made in 25 years, and the last year in particular, are astounding. See for yourself :)

Love,
Ginny

# A Trip Down Memory Lane...

## May 1, 2017
I am in moz. I like my host family and house. My name means "he does" in Portuguese.

In Portuguese: "Ele" means he and it pronounced how we say "ellie." So people keep telling stories about people and all I can here is "ellie *rapid Portuguese* ellie *rapid Portuguese*." And interestingly enough "faz" means does and is pronounced how we say "fahs." 

So ellie fahs sounds exactly like "ele faz" meaning "he does" which is said quite a lot especially during these first few weeks of introductions. For the record "ela faz" means "she does" and that kinda sounds like my name too and I feel all empowered by that one.

A note on pronunciation difficulties in Portuguese: 
O=u 
S=z/ch
C=s 
Ç exists 
Lh is to be said through your nose 
A, à, á, â, ã <-are all different and the various accent marks exist for most vowels

All I do is sit in class and do chores.

Site announcement went down like Greek life Bid Day. We got all dressed up, the country director made a speech. We were given envelopes but were told we could not open them— a terrible practice that should be done away with. Then we all opened them at once and ran to the giant chalk map of Mozambique to see who would be living in the same province. Some cheering, some crying, many hugs, then we ate cake.

So...I just arrived. 3 chapas- panel van turned into public transit. This is the butt in your face, passing children and live chickens through the window type deal- and a ferry to get here. Over the course of 7 hours. Its really small and really removed. Drove through a looooot of bush to get here. I havnt really walked around but I'm kind of freaking out from what I've seen so far. like bad freaking out. Like really scared about living here for 2 years. It's not only rural and tiny but it isolated and the roads are not good. Like in case of emergency I'm fucked. Like it took 1.5 very bumpy hours to go 42 km 

* 2 hours later *

Feeling a lot better about things. I’m fed and quasi oriented to the house. Bathroom and bathing area are outside. But I'm not allowed to leave the house at night so I have a bucket in my room if I have to go at night (cue Glamorous by Fergie). My room locks and I have a mosquito net. The family I'm staying with is suuuuuper nice. It's 11 people of 3 generations so if I win with them I'll be taping into a lot of the community. But that also means if they don't like me I'm fuuuuuuucked.

## June 22 2017
I'm pretty fucking scared that I'm going to be living here for 2 years.

Low point: shadowed a counseling session. A woman who is HIV+ gave birth to twins one year ago. One boy and one girl. She took the recommended drug cocktail to prevent mother-to-child transmission religiously while pregnant and both babies were born negative. She is from a remote area and her family cannot afford (time and money wise) to provide all members with a balanced diet. For this reason, she chose to breastfeed the boy and give the girl powdered milk. He is the first son of the generation. 

She did not know that she had to keep taking the medication while breastfeeding. Her son is HIV+ and her daughter is pretty undernourished and noticeably smaller than her twin brother. The treatment plan involves nutritional supplements for the daughter and ARTs for mother and son. 

High point of the day: feeling proud that my country funds programs and delivers diagnosis, treatment and counseling for those in areas where HIV/AIDS is endemic. Do PEPFAR, USAID, and Peace Corps operate perfectly in the MOST globally responsible sustainable manner? No. Though I believe that Mozambique will one day be self sustaining in these services, I am proud that my resource rich country did not turn a blind eye when it was/is in a position to make large scale improvement.

I was looking forward to coming back to Namaacha for a variety of reasons. The familiarity, the routine, people who understood my Portuguese, and the fact that I had cleaned/organized my room really well before leaving. I had put everything except for my clothing locked in the large trunk that Peace Corps gave us all upon arrival. 

My trunk was stolen out of my room in my absence. People ask what was taken but it's easier to list what I have left: my clothes, my bedding, my water filter, and phase 2 bag. The thief (possibly thieves) was able to climb in and out through a window where the wood around the lock has rotted.

Every human in the world lives without the contents of that trunk everyday. I will be fine. It royally sucks, but I will be fine.

On Thursday, I swore in as an official Peace Corps Volunteer. It was at the US embassy and we all raised our right hand and first took the oath that every government employee must take then the Peace Corps oath. I've included them below in the post script. I was seated front and center meaning the only thing between me and the ambassador was the podium with the national seal on it. I gotta say it felt like a really big moment. 

The news station was at the swear in ceremony! Also, most people watch or listen to the news religiously. We use it as a landmark hour for HIV patients because ART treatment needs to be taken at the same time daily. This, combined with the fact that I wore my Peace Corps tshirt in transit to site yesterday meant that people recognized the logo and came up to talk with me! Some in English some in Portuguese, but a handful of people on the ferry ride and chapa ride to my site thanked me for serving their country which was met with smiles from other passengers. This felt SO GOOD!!! After I thanked one man who literally pointed me towards the correct chapa he said "you're giving us your whole life, I'm barely giving you my finger!" <--sounds weird when directly translated but it was very sweet.

## August 14 2017
I’m FINALLY doing what I came here to do. What is that you may ask? GREAT question. The blanket answer is that I am here to understand the needs of this community and design projects to help address said needs while keeping in mind Peace Corps: Health Program's goals related to HIV/AIDS, malaria and international friendship. Which is all well and good as an elevator pitch but it's difficult to hit the ground running when the first and most important verb there is "understand." 

BATS: holy my the bats. The first time one flew in, I was on the phone with Ginny telling her how much I loved my house. I ran outside and started crying while she so kindly stayed on the line. She then coached me through locking my house up for the night and hiding under my mosquito net. She also hoped to lighten my spirits by trying to think of it as a pet I could brag about in the future but that conjured up a few too many wicked witch of the west imagery and I had to tell her that I was not on board. 

I told my neighbors and co-workers about the bats. My responses were along the lines of "you live on a fruit grove, what did you expect?" or "yea....us too...." or  "you have a broom, why don't you kill them?". I called my landlord who kind of had a "yea and the problem is...?" Tone. When I eventually wailed that I was scared, he laughed and said he didn't have enough money to fix the roof and that he wouldn't be back in my part of the district for quite some time. 



## September 9 2017
So much of my time is spent doing chores and I'm totally fine with it. In training it drove me crazy, now I almost look forward to it. Scratch that I do look forward to it. I found myself thinking “I really want to leave so I can go home and sweep my house.” There is a weird serenity and satisfaction that I can't describe. Especially after being robbed! I take so much care of what I do have.

Reflection on language: humans don't actually say that much.

Be nicer to foreigners. If someone looks awkward/scared/confused, they probably feel that way too. Sure its not your job to help, but ….I'm trying to decide if I want to spin this point in the kosher way and say “build up some good karma” or if I want to say what I mean which is “be a fucking human.”

I still feel like an outsider but I am now moving from assessing the situation to seeing how I can help with the limited skills and resources that I have. Again this e-mail is going to take much more form of stories/observations rather than what I think about them. I feel like so often travel blogs/whatever genre we want to call it have a grand realization at the end. At this point...this is my life. I am 6 months in with 21 months to go. A lot of it doesn't feel like something to report and I'm barely treading water let alone making shocking discoveries related to international development, culture, infectious disease, personal growth, or this crazy beautiful world that we live in.

I went to Ponta do Ouro for dinner with a fellow Peace Corps Volunteer and two South Africans who we knew from the serendipitous ways that young people travelling alone find eathogher. Ponta do Ouro is in my district on the Mozambican/South African border. Form my site, you drive past an Elephant Reserve to get there. On the way back it was very dark. The road is brand spanking new and there are no street lights. In my opinion, we were driving insanely fast. When I voiced this concern, the South African driving rhetorically asked “what on earth could we possibly run into?” in reference to the fact that we were in the middle of nowhere and it is very rare for people to have cars. All of a sudden, he slams on the break and swerves off the road. The sun had gone down but the pavement on the road was still hot and there was an elephant calf rolling around on it, enjoying the heat of the asphalt on it's skin. The elephants tusks were still pretty small which made that “smile” that elephants seem to have all the more prevalent. It looked like it was playing. For those that know Bear, it looked like when he rolls on his back and can't decide which way he wants his head to be – but then add a trunk that is going like a crazy straw. There were two Mozambican men trying to coax the Elephant off the road but.....the elephant knew that it was an elephant. We watched it for a bit and then kept going.

A woman named Angeline, who was on my team for the mosquito net distribution campaign, owns a local bar and has been very kind about openly including me. During some downtime at the mosquito net distribution, a colleague started asking me about what I do outside of work. I told them the truth: I do chores, I work out, I read, maybe I'll call people from home. Honestly my social life at site is walking around and hoping that people talk to me. The colleague was like “that sounds boring and lonely.” I couldn't argue. Angeline was there for the conversation and now she will call me to come over and offers me water/soda/beer. When she makes vegetables she makes enough for me and calls me to come by after work for dinner. It is so incredibly nice of her!

Yesterday I was at Angeline's barracca with about 4 other women. One of them all of a sudden said, “Ellen I was white I know I would be just like you! I would want to help people. I'd go all over the world and help people. I'd be a missionary! Instead I'm one of the people who needs help.” This launched a conversation into what each of them would do if they were white. Two of them spoke about what they would do with their hair and make up but mostly they were talking about what they would do with a lot of money and opportunity to travel.

I found this line of thought super interesting. “Would you be a different person if you were a different race?” As much as we all want to say no, I bet the answer is yes. Then taking it further, “how do you think you'd be different?”

New Years I went beach camping with a bunch of other Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs)at a beach called Praia de Tofo in the central province of Inhambane. Backpackers and PCVs from all over South Eastern Africa were there which was really cool. New Years in Tofo is a very popular destination in this part of the world. The thing with beach camping in extreme heat in Sub-Saharan Africa is that you can either be in your tent, where there is shade, but you are being cooked. Or, you can be on the beach, where there is breeze and the ocean but you're likely getting burned. What we should have been doing, was laying in the shade hydrating all day. But, being adventurous people in their early twenties at a beach festival on New Years, that is not really what was happening. I'm glad I went. I would have had major FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) if I hadn't. That being said, I don't think I need to beach camp in the middle of summer in Sub-Saharan Africa again. But, who knows. It was really cool talking with PCVs from other countries and feeling like “one of the cool kids” because I could help translate.

I feel like people can be put in 2 categories- mainly dictated by what they choose to do in their free-time. There are those that go to the barracas and those that go to church.

The community-based lifestyle here transcends pretty much every boundary that I can think of. Neighbors share. Everything. As an American, it was (and still sometimes is) very uncomfortable when people ask me for things. Though I do field more of this than the average person due to my nationality and perceived wealth, this is part of the culture especially in small rural communities. Its beautiful in a lot of ways. Families take in children of their neighbors who have fallen ill, passed away or have to leave the community to find work or care for a loved one in another village. When fruit trees ripen, the whole neighborhood is welcome to the crop. Nobody is every out of something unless the whole neighborhood is out of it. With regards to my specific situation, I've explained to my neighbors that Americans are just more private people with more boundaries and that Peace Corps has a lot of rules about what I can and cannot give because they are the ones funding me. Both are true to some degree.

What I wanted to talk about was how sometimes the community mind-set can be a barrier to individual economic growth. There is an idea of “if someone gets ahead we all get ahead!” Which is great! But it also means that if someone is up on their luck, their neighbors often come and ask for things and there is much more responsibility to distribute the wealth. The “get ahead” mindset is not really a thing. An example of this is that all products at the market are the same price no matter which vendor you go to. A kilo of tomatoes is always 40 mets. A small carrot is 10 mets and a large one is 20. Pineapple is 45 mets. Small bags of peanuts are 5 mets and larger ones are 10 mets. One time I suggested to a friend who sells peanuts in the market that maybe she add something to hers -salt, dried fruit, maybe sugar – and sell them for a higher price. She told me that that would not be fair to the other ladies that sell peanuts and that they would be angry with her. She also looked at me like I had two heads and told me that is not how you eat peanuts.

People put sugar in avocado and serve it as a dessert. When I describe guacamole people think it sounds disgusting.

## May 20 2017
There is a frog living in my well. Reminder about my water situation: I have an in ground well in my back yard. I move a concrete slab, throw in my bucket and draw water to put into my carrying buckets. From the carrying buckets the water either goes into my bigger barrel in my kitchen area or into basins in my bathroom area. A frog has started living in my well. It is a bullfrog sized frog. I have mixed feelings about this. I do not know how he got in and I do not know if he can get out. I desperately hope that it is a male frog because I am not crazy about the thought of tadpoles in my water. There are plenty of bugs for him to eat in there so I'm sure he can stay in there for a while. I am also not crazy about the thought of frog excrement in my water but I like that thought more than the thought of a dead frog festering in my water. He is scared of the bucket so I don't think fishing him out is a real possibility. I am wondering (hoping?) that dead frogs float. Anyhow, stay tuned. I'm not too worried. I do treat all drinking water and most water that I use for cooking. <--Update on this situation: after a heavy rain (meaning the water level in the well was pretty high) my 11 year old neighbor (Mano) tied knots in the rope and waited for the frog to jump onto a knot for a much needed rest. It took a few tries but eventually Mano was able to slowly pull up the frog and it happily hopped away.

In trying to write an e-mail I am struggling with wanting to share realities of life here while trying to not perpetuate stereotypes about “Africa.” That is difficult as stereotypes are always sprouted from a kernel of truth. The fact of the matter is, life is hard here. Life can be hard in the States too but in very different ways. Colleagues and community members often ask about life in the States. Their impressions come from movies, TV shows, music and occasionally current events. I've been asked if there is poverty/HIV/disease/farms in the States. To which the answer is, “Yes! We have poverty/HIV/disease/suffering but it looks very different than it does here.”

<img src="ellie_water.jpg">

There are also insanely happy and beautiful parts of life here just as there are in the States.
I also don't want to feed into the “Barbie Savior” narrative. (https://www.instagram.com/barbiesavior/?hl=en <-- a satirical instagram account that pokes fun at voluntourism and the "Save Africa" complex.)  I mostly think of this when it comes to sharing pictures. I don't like the connotations that arise from pictures of blonde girls playing with dirty African children. But objectively, that is what is happening for a chunk of every day.

I see and hear a lot of really difficult things. I feel guilty even saying that because what I see/hear is someone's reality. I feel bad writing about that with the intent to update friends and family. It feels like I am showcasing the suffering. Again, it also feels like I am only giving one side of the story—the part about how hard life is.
